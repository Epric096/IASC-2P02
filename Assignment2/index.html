    <h1>The Little Prince</h1>
    <h2>ChingKai Huang (Eric)</h2>


    <p>For this assignment, I am visualizing the novel The Little Prince written by Antonie de Saint-Exupéry. This is a fictional novel targeting the age group of children to adults. The story is from a pilot's perspective about how he meets the main character, the little prince, in the Sahara desert after an airplane accident. The little prince is coming from another planet, Asteroid 325, and decides to travel around the world because he feels betrayed by a rose on the planet. Little Prince has seen many grown-up worlds, learned many meaningful experiences, and eventually made a deal with the snake to head back to his planet. The novel has a wide imagination and can help build the visualization for this assignment, and each character has a strong connection with the main character.
    </p>

    <p>For the first visualization, I used an octahedron corresponding to the star (planet) representing the characters, because each planet in the novel has a different characteristic person living on them. In the visualization, we can see the little prince appear throughout the story and has a greater density than in the beginning, often colliding with other terms showing the interaction in between. By turning off the prince term we can see the term rose shown in the graph appears a few times in the beginning, significantly increased at the end. Although Rose is a very important character in the novel, but gives little information at the start and leaves an awkward gap in between the graph, this is one insight. The fox is a friend and a teacher of the little prince who appears around the end, interacting with another important character Rose in the visualization. Even though Rose and Fox are both shown together in the visualization, they never meet in the novel, this is another insight. I created a star-drop animation for this visualization to show how the main character connects everything. (turn on and off Prince term to see the connection during the animation)
        Instruction for the first visualization: After viewing the visualization (moved around), click Star Drop, and move (Right-click and drag) the camera to check the top and bottom for a better view of the visualization.

    </div>

    <p>The second visualization is about the important object inside the novel and assign them to related colours. The main purose of the book is to fix the airplane and flying out of the Sahara desert. At the end of the novel the pilot fixed the airplane but in the visualization it does not show any object high up. This is an interesting finding when I put down this word so I am guessing the author called it another name, aircraft or just describe the pilot fly out. (this is one insight) In the graph, I found out when the author uses the word planet more, the word star decrease and vice versa. I could never realize this if I did not look at the visualization because I understand both term has the same meaning. (this is another insight) The animation I’m doing for this visualization is animating them to move around, just like the stars in space moving in a pattern. All of the term I used that can fly and float in the space. Sybolizing the explore and freedom in the book.Instruction for the second visualization: zoom out and use top to bottom view</p>

        <h2> Important term in Little Prince</h2>

    <p>One thing I would liked to do for my visualization that I could not accomplish is finding the correct camera, I tried using console log the camera rotation and position and used the value, but they are still off. Another thing I would like to accomplish is assign the new position of individual children in first visualzation instead of collabing all together. For overall visualization I would like to use the free Github background to make my website more interesting, using a different text style, and more interaction buttons.</p>
