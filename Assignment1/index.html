        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>People lived inside caves for a decade, cave dwellers, enjoying their time inside their lovely cold house. Cave dwellers have their individual groups from families and families. They were satisfied with how they lived and did not have the motivation to explore the outside world. The only source of entertainment and the only way for these people to see the outside world is by looking at the shadow on the wall. Eventually, the shadow becomes their belief, that it was god's blessing to show them the world, what to avoid and what to hunt based on the size of the shadow. One day a growling voice came from the entrance and echoed in the cave, smashing everyones head. Suddenly, cave dwellers saw <spam class="clickable" id="first-change">a weird shape moving back and forth on the wall</spam>, it was ginormous, from the cave floor to the cave ceiling, with sharp edges that looked like it could cut everything into pieces. The people were shocked and terrified because it did not look like anything from before, from their understanding everything has two or four legs, one can swing and fly and the other can run faster than cave people. Their mind is empty, standing in front of the wall and wondering what will happen to them.</p>
    
        <p>With unexpected happens to the creature, <spam class="clickable" id="second-change">the shadow began to move faster than normal</spam>. This time the cave people can barely see the shadow on the wall. The cave dwellers can only know it is strong because it can move fast and it is dangerous because of its shape. Each time the shadow disappeared, the cave people were praying it never showed up again, thinking it was the godsend to clean them up. With the worldview of cave people, there is a strong connection between people to flatness. Nick Sousanisâ€™s concept of Flatness is represented by people with a limited view, such as people inside a flat surface, the only option that the person can think of is moving North, West, East, and South, there are more directions but the person does not know the existence and understand the concept of it. People are stubborn and blocked of vision, any unexpected behaviour will stop the person, rejecting anything above their understanding unless they see or experience it. To my understanding of flatness, flatness is a lack of resources and knowledge, only using the current assets without absorbing more front the outside world.</p>

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>

        <p>It was nice and shiny weather in the outside world, the weather was clear no clouds blocking the sun. People can clearly see the creature flying close to the ground is a jet plane. A few hundred meters away from the plane, people could see a cave hole. People outside can understand the creature easily because they have seen multiple variants of the plane each day, and they have seen many other transportation tools other than jet planes. At one point they can see the plane starting to speed up flying in one area. People were calm because they knew there was an even faster transportation tool than the jet plane or they had the speed-up experience when sitting on a transportation plane. Suddenly,<spam class="clickable" id="third-change"> two missiles from a mile away aimed the jet plane</spam>, and people around started to freak out and run toward a safe place. People around the area understand what will happen if the missiles explode and the damage and threaten their lives. They saw the jet plane dodge the missiles but the fear did not end because they knew there would be more missiles coming soon to target the jet plane.</p>
    
        <p>Nick Sousanis concept of Seeing Double does not look at an event with only one perspective, try to use both eyes or more to look at one thing. There is more than one pathway leading to success, closing one eye and switching between can break through the mist that is always troubling you. Do not always set yourself as the center of everything, look around and you will find more truth. Feeling free to ask and answer, seek the unknown, and fight against weakness, eventually become one of your strengths. Comparing the cave people's view and the outside view, we can see that when facing danger, cave people were lack of knowledge and would not take any action to prevent or self-protecting, standing there and praying nothing would happen to them. The outside people have more space to escape than the cave people. Their first impression of the jet plane is different, to cave people it is a monster, however to outside people, it is a useful tool. When combining both views, the jet plane can fly to any area other than just within the wall. Although the jet plane shadow is very close to the wall it is still very far away from the cave people. Last but not least, the sunset and the story ends.<spam class="clickable" id="fourth-change"> The sunset and the story ends</spam>.</p>
