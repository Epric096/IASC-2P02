        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>People lived inside caves for a decade, cave dwellers, enjoying their time inside their lovely cold house. Cave dwellers have their individual groups from families and families. They were satisfied with how they lived and did not have the motivation to explore the outside world. The only source of entertainment and the only way for these people to see the outside world is by looking at the shadow on the wall. Eventually, the shadow becomes their belief, that it was god's blessing to show them the world, what to avoid and what to hunt based on the size of the shadow. One day a growling voice came from the entrance and echoed in the cave, smashing everyones head. Suddenly, cave dwellers saw <spam class="clickable" id="first-change">a weird shape moving back and forth on the wall</spam>, it was ginormous, from the cave floor to the cave ceiling, with sharp edges that looked like it could cut everything into pieces. The people were shocked and terrified because it did not look like anything from before, from their understanding everything has two or four legs, one can swing and fly and the other can run faster than cave people. Their mind is empty, standing in front of the wall and wondering what will happen to them.</p>
    
        <p>With unexpected happens to the creature, <spam class="clickable" id="second-change">the shadow began to move faster than normal</spam>. This time the cave people can barely see the shadow on the wall. The cave dwellers can only know it is strong because it can move fast and it is dangerous because of its shape. Each time the shadow disappeared, the cave people were praying it never showed up again, thinking it was the godsend to clean them up. With the worldview of cave people, there is a strong connection between people to flatness. Nick Sousanisâ€™s concept of Flatness is represented by people with a limited view, such as people inside a flat surface, the only option that the person can think of is moving North, West, East, and South, there are more directions but the person does not know the existence and understand the concept of it. People are stubborn and blocked of vision, any unexpected behaviour will stop the person, rejecting anything above their understanding unless they see or experience it. To my understanding of flatness, flatness is a lack of resources and knowledge, only using the current assets without absorbing more front the outside world.</p>
